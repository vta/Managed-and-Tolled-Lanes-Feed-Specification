# Managed and Tolled Lanes Feed Specification

Proposal for a schema that comprise the Managed and Tolled Lanes Tolling Feed Specification (MTLFS) and defines the fields used in all of those files.

## Why
The goal of this effort is to establish an open format data feed specification that the managed lanes and toll industry can use which can allow for creative application development to provide customer friendly information via various means such as smart phones or provide opportunity for alternate payment systems.  This should enhance the customer decision making and experience while allowing the toll operator to share real-time information in a more direct manner than via the fixed overhead panels on the system.

The goal of this effort is to establish an open format data feed specification that the managed lanes and toll industry can share.  The concept is to share this data feed for creative application development and provide customer friendly information via various means such as smart phones and tripplanners, or to provide opportunities for alternate payment systems. This data feed could enhance the customer decision making experience above and beyond just using fixed overhead panels.
